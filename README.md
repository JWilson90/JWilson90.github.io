Anthropologically, cooking is known as one of the capacities that sets humans apart from animals.  In order to learn about a culture, one should look to the styles and flavors of a cultures traditional staples in order to aid in understanding etiquette around the table, and in a particular society.  One quote I have taken to heart is “if you want to understand a culture, you must go through their stomachs”.  The Hungry Archaeologist is a preservation project in which chefs and the average home cook can have an opportunity to gain knowledge about traditional culinary styles that may have been forgotten over the years.  In order to give cooks an opportunity to view and try out these traditional foods, the form of this website is to be a recipe and food blog.  Recipes from multiple cultural backgrounds and styles will be included for those of you who wish to try and make them for yourselves.
